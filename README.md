# Wifimap
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gpaddis/wifimap.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/gpaddis/wifimap)

Parse dump files generated by [airodump-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) and get a structured collection of access points, stations and probes. You can then import the formatted data into your application, e.g. to build a database or a map of wireless networks and clients.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wifimap'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wifimap

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
